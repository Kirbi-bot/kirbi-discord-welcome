# kirbi-discord-welcome module
A module for [Kirbi](https://github.com/richardson-media-house/kirbi), that adds a command for displaying content of a file, aimed specifically at a Discord welcome channel.

Depends on [kirbi-discord](https://github.com/Richardson-Media-House/kirbi-discord).

## Usage

Add a welcome.md file to your `/extras` folder in the core bot, and this command will spit out the contents to your welcome channel. If you want more than one message, add a break with the content `=====`.
